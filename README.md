This is intended to be used with the CCTHUNDER modpack... Contents of said pack reproduced in the minimal form required for import into ATLAUNCHER here due to being a combo curse-modrinth bundle; as combo packs are effectively unhostable on both.



To use import the modpack into ATlauncher and then copy the zip files in the instances imported "datapacks" directory. Copy these files into the datapaks folder for your world at creation time, loading anything with JJTHUNDER is not safe for existing worlds and is not recommended.
